# Tiling Networks

To run this application, you must setup your database first. Once that is done,
you must run the client and the server. Open up two terminal windows. In one terminal window, run:

`cd server`

`python3 server.py`

In another terminal window, run:

`cd client`

`yarn install` (if this is the first time setting it up)

`yarn start`
